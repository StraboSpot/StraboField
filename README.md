# StraboField

StraboField is an application in the StraboSpot ecosystem to collect geologic data in a field setting, and is designed to be used by geologists, geology students, and others. The application allows the collection of geologic data using a variety of base maps - including maps, cross-sections, sketches, and images prepared by other users - referenced to their location on the Earth. StraboSpot utilizes a controlled vocabulary developed over years of discussion in the professional geologic community. The application uses nested spots (areas of observation) for spatial grouping of data and tags for conceptual grouping of data. The application currently focuses on Structural Geology and Tectonics data, but is expanding to include Petrology and Sedimentary Geology data.

The development of StraboSpot was sponsored by the United States National Science Foundation. It provides the ability to put field data into a transparent and open framework, allowing effective cyberinfrastructure development within the Earth Sciences. The data imported into StraboSpot is directly stored in a database that is designed to accommodate the digital data reporting requirements of National Science Foundation grants and allows retrieval by researchers. More explanation of StraboSpot and a desktop version with expanded tools are at https://strabospot.org.

StraboSpot uses a Neo4j graph database to give persistence to observations, photographs, or any other images imported by the user. The system compiles the complex relationships between observations (including temporal information, such as cross-cutting relations) and provide flexible options for access, editing, and sharing of field data.

The application will work on mobile devices with or without connection to Wi-Fi or Cellular networks. When an Internet connection is available, users both can upload collected information and backup their device. It is available for all devices on the Google Play and Apple App stores.

This is a [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

## Step 1: Getting Started

- Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

- Create a `env.json` file at project root and add:

      {
       "mapbox_access_token": 'Your Mapbox public access token'
       "Error_reporting_DSN": 'Optional Sentry DNS or other error reporting service'
      }

- Create a `dev-test-logins.js` in project root and add:

      export const USERNAME_TEST = 'your username/email';
      export const PASSWORD_TEST = 'your password';

## Step 2: Install Packages

Install packages by running

    yarn

#### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

    bundle install

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

    bundle exec pod install

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

## Step 3: Run 

### Development

---

#### Android

    npm run android

#### iOS

    npm run ios

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

*This is one way to run your app â€” you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.*

#### Web

    npm run web

### Release/Production

---

#### Android

Add your Android signing information. 

- Create `keystore.properties` in `/android` and add (without the quotes):


    storePassword='your store password'
    keyPassword='your key password'
    keyAlias='your key alias'
    storeFile='your store file'

- Add your Java Keystore file (.jks) to `/android/app`

Run app

    npm run android-release

#### Web

    npm run web-deploy
