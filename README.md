# StraboSpot2

StraboSpot is an application to collect geologic data in a field setting, and is designed to be used by geologists, geology students, and others. The application allows the collection of geologic data using a variety of base maps - including maps, cross-sections, sketches, and images prepared by other users - referenced to their location on the Earth. StraboSpot utilizes a controlled vocabulary developed over years of discussion in the professional geologic community. The application uses nested spots (areas of observation) for spatial grouping of data and tags for conceptual grouping of data. The application currently focuses on Structural Geology and Tectonics data, but is expanding to include Petrology and Sedimentary Geology data.


The development of StraboSpot was sponsored by the United States National Science Foundation. It provides the ability to put field data into a transparent and open framework, allowing effective cyberinfrastructure development within the Earth Sciences. The data imported into StraboSpot is directly stored in a database that is designed to accommodate the digital data reporting requirements of National Science Foundation grants and allows retrieval by researchers. More explanation of StraboSpot and a desktop version with expanded tools are at https://strabospot.org.


StraboSpot uses a Neo4j graph database to give persistence to observations, photographs, or any other images imported by the user. The system compiles the complex relationships between observations (including temporal information, such as cross-cutting relations) and provide flexible options for access, editing, and sharing of field data.


The application will work on mobile devices with or without connection to Wi-Fi or Cellular networks. In offline mode, StraboSpot can store both Mapbox (https://www.mapbox.com) and Map Warper (http://mapwarper.net) to provide base maps for data collection. When an Internet connection is available, users both can upload collected information and backup their data on their iPad or iPhone.

This is a [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

## Step 1: Getting Started

- Create a `env.json` file at project root and add:

      {
       "mapbox_access_token": 'Your Mapbox public access token'
       "Error_reporting_DSN": 'Optional Sentry DNS or other error reporting service'
      }

- Create a `dev-test-logins.js` in project root and add:

      export const USERNAME_TEST = 'your username/email';
      export const PASSWORD_TEST = 'your password';

Android
- Create `gradle.properties` in `android/.gradle` and add (without the quotes):

      MAPBOX_DOWNLOADS_TOKEN='MAPBOX_DOWNLOADS_SECRET_TOKEN'

## Step 2: Install Packages

Run `npm install`

## Step 3: Run Natively

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Run in Web

```bash
# using npm
npm run web
```
